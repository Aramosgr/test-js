# INCENTIVE GAMES

Hi! This is a Javascript test where you will code some functions to prove what you are made of (nothing too complicated, this won´t take more than 30 minutes).

Use ES6 if you are familiar with it.

## HOW TO DO IT

Simply clone the repository and edit the index.js file. 

Please send your solution or any question/feedback to aaron@incentivegames.com

Good luck!

## EXAMPLE

```
const mySolution = () => {
  const n = 6 + 4;
  console.log(`The solution is ${n}`);
}

// Please run the file to see the results
mySolution();
```

## BONUS POINTS

If you want to prove your React skills too, there is also a test called reactTest.tsx.

All you need to do is edit that file adding the code the TestComponent needs, and send it to us. There is no need of installing anything or rendering the component.
