# INCENTIVE GAMES

Hi! This is a Javascript test where you will code some functions to prove what you are made of (nothing too complicated or long).

Use ES6 if you are familiar with it.

## HOW TO DO IT

Simply clone the repository and edit the index.js file. 

Please send your solution or any question/feedback to graham.macdonald@incentivegames.com

Good luck!

## EXAMPLE

```
const mySolution = () => {
  const n = 6 + 4;
  console.log(`The solution is ${n}`);
}

// Please run the file to see the results
mySolution();
```
